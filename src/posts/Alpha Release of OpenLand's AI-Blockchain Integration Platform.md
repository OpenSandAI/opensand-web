OpenSand is the first on-chain trustworthy AGI governance protocol. Through decentralized governance, it enables AGI to reach a trustworthy consensus while empowering communities under the premise of protecting community consensus. We hope that every community has the right to possess a trustworthy AGI that upholds the community's consensus, thereby preserving the diversity of "consciousness" in the digital world of AGI.
