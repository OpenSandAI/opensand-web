**OpenSand** is a platform that lets people ask questions, get instant answers, and have back-and-forth conversations with a wide variety of AI-powered bots. It is available on web.

The AI on OpenSand is powered by models from several sources, trained by different companies. Those different models are optimized for different tasks, represent different points of view, or have access to different knowledge. Some models are fine-tuned versions of models created by others.

OpenSand currently supports ChatGPT, GPT-4 and DALL-E 3 from OpenAI, Claude Instant and Claude 2 from Anthropic, StableDiffusionXL from Stability AI, PaLM and Gemini-Pro from Google, Llama 2 from Meta, Playground-v2 by Playground, Mistral-Medium by Mistral, and many other bots created by the community. We hope to be a way for people to collectively explore the possibilities opened up by new AI models as they are released.

Please keep in mind that the AI available through Poe is not perfect, so it will be useful in some cases but not in others. We will do our best to fix the problems within our control as quickly as possible, but it will take time for AI research to continue to advance to the point where many of the flaws we see today are addressed. Until that happens, we hope the features on Poe will help you discover use cases where it can be helpful immediately.

We will be doing our best to build Poe as quickly as possible so that everyone can benefit from AI as this incredible technology becomes available to the world.
