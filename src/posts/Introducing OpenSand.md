# OpenSand: A Community-Driven Trusted AGI Governance Protocol

OpenSand is a community-driven protocol for trusted AGI governance that aims to address the challenges of trust, consensus, and responsible development in the era of artificial general intelligence (AGI). By leveraging decentralized storage, hybrid consensus mechanisms, and zero-knowledge proofs, OpenSand enables the creation of AGIs that are transparent, auditable, and reflective of diverse community values. The protocol empowers communities to build, govern, and benefit from their own AGIs while ensuring data privacy, model verifiability, and scalable computing power. Through partnerships with academic institutions like the Hong Kong Generative AI Research Center, OpenSand combines cutting-edge research with real-world applications to drive innovation in the field of AGI. As a truly open and collaborative platform, OpenSand represents a significant step towards realizing the potential of AGI technology in a trustworthy and inclusive manner.


## Background: Where are we now?

### AGI is coming, Pandora’s box is openning?

The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) is disrupting our world. The emergence of artificial general intelligence (AGI), the ultimate goal of AI technology, may fundamentally change the course of human civilization.

Large language models, led by ChatGPT, have begun to take shape as AGI. General and high-quality question-answering services provide assistance in writing, programming, data analysis and other areas, improving work and learning efficiency. However, the training data of language models has limitations and biases, and the output content inevitably contains errors, biases and other issues, creating a crisis of trust and seriously undermining consensus. In addition, the abuse of privacy information and harmful data can lead to AI being used for malicious purposes, creating false information and dangerous content. s urgently need a trustworthy AGI.

### Co-Governance: the only way to trust

In modern society, trust is an important cornerstone for maintaining social stability and promoting social development. However, in a complex and changing social environment, how to establish and maintain trust has become a pressing problem. Co-governance provides a viable way to solve the trust problem.

The same is true for AGI.

No matter how powerful AGI is, if it cannot win the trust of users, it will eventually be restricted. Only through open source, open collaboration and co-governance can AGI be used safely and widely.

### Of the community, by the community, for the community

AI is not Coca-Cola, with the same flavor all over the world.

Through trustworthy co-governance, AGI will be shaped by consensus. However, due to differences in culture, ethnicity, religion, beliefs, etc. among humans, consensus cannot be reached on most things, so how to construct an AGI that is trustworthy for all?

The answer is that there is no need to build an AGI that is trustworthy for everyone. Different communities have different consensuses and should therefore have different AGIs. Each AGI should be built by the community, governed by the community, and serve the community.

## How OpenSand works

### Data: Governance-Enabled Decentralized Data Storage Marketplace

OpenSand uses DSM (Decentralized Storage Marketplace) to manage data. DSM aims to provide users with secure, efficient, and low-cost data storage and distribution services, and to provide training materials for AGI.

Through DSM, users can easily place storage orders on the chain and distribute their valuable data to the Sand Network. Unlike traditional centralized storage solutions, DSM is deeply integrated with the IPFS network. Data transmitted to DSM is sliced, encrypted and stored in a distributed manner on IPFS nodes around the world, which not only provides higher data availability and disaster recovery capabilities, but also maximizes the protection of user data privacy and security. This data can not only meet users’ own storage needs, but also serve as training data to support large artificial intelligence language models when authorized by users. When AI needs data for training, it needs to purchase data from DSM.

In DSM, users always have control over their own data and can independently decide on the storage location, access rights and sharing scope of the data. Thanks to the immutability and transparency of blockchain technology, all data operation records will be permanently stored on the chain, and any unauthorized access or tampering will be promptly detected and blocked. Through community governance, DSM can decide which data is used for model training, thus avoiding problems such as harmful data and achieving trustworthiness at the data level.

### Computing Power: AI-MPoW + AI-GPoS

OpenSand’s Sand consensus innovatively combines AI-audited proof-of-work (AI-MPoW) and proof-of-stake (AI-GPoS) to build an efficient, secure, and decentralized hybrid consensus mechanism. Among them, AI-MPoW makes full use of the computing power resources in the network, and uses AI algorithms to audit and verify the workload of nodes to ensure the fairness and reliability of the consensus process. Unlike traditional PoW consensus, AI-MPoW introduces intelligent scheduling and task allocation mechanisms, which can dynamically adjust the work difficulty and reward allocation according to the computing power capacity and historical performance of nodes, thereby incentivizing nodes to provide stable and high-quality computing power services.

At the same time, AI-GPoS allows nodes holding Sand tokens to participate in the consensus process through a proof-of-stake mechanism and obtain corresponding block rewards and transaction fee income. AI-GPoS adopts an AI-driven adaptive incentive and dynamic staking mechanism, intelligently adjusting the block probability and reward ratio of nodes according to factors such as their historical performance, current computing power contribution, and Sand token holdings. This mechanism not only incentivizes nodes to hold Sand tokens for a long time and provide stable computing power support, but also guides nodes to actively participate in ecosystem construction and promote the healthy development of the network.

Sand consensus combines the advantages of AI-MPoW and AI-GPoS to achieve efficient consensus while ensuring decentralization and security, making full use of the computing power resources in the network. In particular, Sand consensus can also achieve the goal of decentralized service of AI models at the consensus layer. By introducing AI models into the consensus process, Sand consensus can achieve advanced functions such as intelligent task allocation, automated performance optimization, and dynamic resource scheduling. This can not only further improve the efficiency and scalability of consensus, but also provide more intelligent and flexible service support for upper-layer applications.

### Algorithm: Consensus Algorithm for Training + ZKML for Inference

In the training phase, Consensus Algorithm for Model Feature Representation Layer Verification Based on Enco&Deco Structure is an innovative consensus algorithm designed to solve the problem of feature representation and verification of multi-modal AI models in a blockchain environment. The algorithm introduces a Self-Learning unsupervised training feature extraction model that can convert any type of model into a unified Feature Tensor representation. This process automatically learns and extracts the intrinsic features of the model through deep learning algorithms to generate high-dimensional, abstract feature representations, thus achieving a unified description and comparison of multi-modal models.

After feature extraction, the algorithm adopts an efficient tensor encoding model to convert the Feature Tensor into a compact string representation. This encoding process can significantly reduce the storage and transmission overhead of feature representations while retaining the key information of the features. Through this Enco&Deco structure, the algorithm achieves efficient compression and decompression of model features, laying the foundation for subsequent consensus verification.

Unlike traditional address verification mechanisms based on direct SHA256 encoding, this algorithm introduces the feature transformation function f(x) provided by the multimodal AI model to transform the address verification process into the form of address = SHA256(f(x)). Among them, f(x) is provided by the trained AI model and can extract robust, highly discriminative feature representations from the raw data. This mechanism not only provides more fine-grained, semantic feature comparison capabilities, but also effectively resists various adversarial attacks and malicious tampering.

In the inference phase, OpenSand effectively solves the two key issues of user privacy protection and model verifiability in the inference phase by innovatively introducing zero-knowledge machine learning (ZKML) technology.

The user’s raw data is first encrypted and transmitted to the trusted execution environment (TEE) on the chain. The TEE uses the ZKP protocol to perform privacy-preserving inference computation on the encrypted data to obtain the encrypted inference results. This process ensures the confidentiality of user data, and even the operators of OpenSand cannot access or spy on the user’s raw data.

At the same time, in order to ensure the credibility and verifiability of the inference results, OpenSand introduces a model verification mechanism based on ZKML. Through zero-knowledge proofs, the TEE can prove the correctness of the inference process to users and other relevant parties without disclosing the details of the model. This mechanism effectively prevents malicious nodes from providing false or misleading inference services and ensures the quality and reliability of AI services.

## Why OpenSand

### Real OpenAI

The OpenSand protocol is a truly Open AGI platform in the real sense. It is not only open source and open at the technical level, but also collaborative and co-governed at the conceptual level.

OpenSand not only opens up the core code and algorithms, but also the entire process of model training, deployment, and service. Anyone can build their own AGI applications based on the OpenSand protocol, and anyone can participate in model training and optimization. This comprehensive openness ensures the transparency and accessibility of AGI technology, prevents technology monopolies and centralization of interests, and lays the foundation for large-scale application of AGI.

Secondly, the OpenSand protocol respects and protects the diversity of “consciousness”. In the OpenSand ecosystem, different participants can train and deploy AGI models with different “consciousness” and “personality” according to their own needs and values. These models can freely interact, collaborate, and compete, forming a diverse and inclusive AGI ecosystem. By introducing the DAO governance mechanism, the OpenSand protocol ensures that every participant has equal voice and decision-making power, avoiding the situation where a few power holders dominate community consensus.

In contrast, some centralized AGI projects like OpenAI, although claiming to be “open”, are not actually Open. They use black box models, lack transparency and auditability, and cannot be widely trusted and commercially used. Some decentralized AGI communities like BitTensor, although realizing model sharing and integration, lack effective governance mechanisms and are prone to being controlled by a few power holders, which may eventually lead to models only reflecting the consensus of a small part of the community.

### Computing Power Restaking

OpenSand has strong strengths and resource guarantees in terms of computing power infrastructure. At present, OpenSand has deployed more than 1,500 H800 high-performance AI accelerator cards, with a total value of about HK$1 billion, providing strong academic computing power support for the platform’s AI services. These computing power resources can not only meet the training and inference needs of OpenSand’s self-developed large models, but also support various AI applications and services on the platform, providing efficient and reliable computing power guarantee for developers and users.

More importantly, OpenSand is not limited to its own computing power resources, but actively expands cooperation with other decentralized computing power platforms to fully utilize the idle computing power in the community and build a general computing power pool. In this way, OpenSand can realize the restaking of computing power, dynamically schedule and optimize its own computing power and community computing power, so as to maximize the efficiency of computing power utilization and reduce the cost of computing power.

Specifically, through docking with decentralized computing power platforms such as Golem and io.net, OpenSand can discover and call idle computing power resources in the community in real time. These resources may come from personal computers, data centers, edge devices and other sources, presenting heterogeneous and dynamically changing characteristics. OpenSand uses intelligent computing power scheduling technology to dynamically select the optimal combination of computing power according to the characteristics and requirements of the task, and distribute the task to the appropriate nodes for execution. At the same time, OpenSand also introduces incentive mechanisms and reputation mechanisms to encourage more computing power providers to join the platform and ensure the quality and stability of computing power services.

Through this scalable computing power architecture, OpenSand can not only meet its own development needs, but also provide computing power support for the entire community and become an important infrastructure for AI services. With the continuous development and growth of the platform, OpenSand will continue to invest academic funds to carry out cutting-edge technology research around self-developed large models, and continuously improve the platform’s technical strength and innovation capabilities.
